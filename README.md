INSAR_G2S is an automated processing to integrate between GMTSAR (the interferogram generation) and StaMPS (the time series InSAR analysis using PS and SB or both).
 
This program was established by the scripts of gmtsar_process, gmtsar2stamps, and gmtsar2stamps_sbas.
gmtsar2stamps was originally from :
- Xiaopeng Tong, Chinese Academy of Sciences
- Xiaohua (Eric) Xu - Scripps Institution of Oceanography
- David Sandwell, Scripps Institution of Oceanography

Please read the guideline to use INSAR_G2S --> guideline_insar_g2s.pdf. 
These scripts can be used for Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR-2 data.
